# Replit's 100 Days of Code Challenge
This is the "100 Days of Code" challenge using Python which is hosted on Replit. The goal of this course is to commit to making one small project every day using Python for 100 days total, which will help me steadily imporove my coding skills and consistency. I have made this repository to track and publish my progress for this challenge.

## Goals
I aim to accomplish the following in taking this challenge:
* build a consistent, daily habit of coding.
* learn and further develop my skills using Python.
* learn how to design and build small projects.

## Daily Progress Tracker
### [Day 1](https://github.com/wanistagg/replit-100-days-of-python/blob/main/day01/hello_world.py)
Learned about print statements and strings. 
Wrote a "statement of intent" using only one print statement declaring my goal of completing all 100 days of this challenge.
