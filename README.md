# Replit's 100 Days of Code Challenge
This is the "100 Days of Code" challenge using Python which is hosted on Replit. The goal of this course is to commit to making one small project every day using Python for 100 days total, which will help me steadily imporove my coding skills and consistency. I have made this repository to track and publish my progress for this challenge.

## Goals
I aim to accomplish the following in taking this challenge:
* build a consistent, daily habit of coding.
* learn and further develop my skills using Python.
* learn how to design and build small projects.

## Daily Progress Tracker
### [Day 1](https://github.com/wanistagg/replit-100-days-of-python/blob/main/day01/hello_world.py)
Learned about print statements, strings and debugging. 
Wrote a "statement of intent" using only one print statement declaring my goal of completing all 100 days of this challenge.
### [Day 2](https://github.com/wanistagg/replit-100-days-of-python/blob/main/day02/inputs_and_variables.py)
Learned about input statements and variables.
Wrote a program for users to enter information about themselves through declaration of variables with input statements. Inputted information is then returned to the user through a range of print statements which include all of the variables in two full sentences.
### [Day 3](https://github.com/wanistagg/replit-100-days-of-python/blob/main/day03/concatenation.py)
Learned about concatenation.
Wrote a program which takes user input to generate a wacky recipe through use of several variables. The resulting recipe prints a sentence comprised of the inputs of all variables, concatenated together with strings.
