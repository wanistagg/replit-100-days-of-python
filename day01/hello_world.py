I'm signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I'll make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling 🥳!
You can follow my progress at replit.com/@wanistagg""")
